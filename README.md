# Readme

This repo will contain url's that are sometimes blocked by (over)aggresive blocklists. Aggresive blocklists can be very useful to combat annoying habits of the internet, which includes (personalised) advertisements and tracking. However, overblocking hurts the user experience.

The goal of this repo is to decrease the amount of annoyance by reducing the amount of websites that are incorrectly blocked, while maintaining user privacy.
